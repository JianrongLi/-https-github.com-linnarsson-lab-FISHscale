    """
    Bin 2D expression data into hexagonal bins.
    
    Input:
    `spacing`(int): distance between tile centers, in same units as the data. 
        The actual spacing will have a verry small deviation (tipically lower 
        than 2e-9%) in the y axis, due to the matplotlib hexbin function.
        The function makes hexagons with the point up: â¬¡
    `title`(list): List of names of the datasets.
    `data`(list): List pandas dataframes with the location data. Should have
        columns "r_stitched_coords" and "c_stitched_coords" for row (X) and 
        column (Y) coordinates respectively. And a columns named "gene" for the 
        gene labels of the detected spots.
    `min_count`(int): Minimal number of molecules in a tile to keep the tile in 
        the dataset. Default = 1. The algorithm will generate a lot of empty 
        tiles, which are later discarded using the min_count threshold.
    
    Output:
    Dictionary with the datasets titles as kyes.
    For each dataset the following items are stored:
    `gene` --> Dictionary with tile counts for each gene.
    `coordinates` --> XY coordinates for all tiles.
    `coordinates_filt` --> XY coordinates for all tiles that have
        enough counts according to "min_count"
    `df` --> Pandas dataframe with counts for all genes in all 
        valid tiles.
    `spacing` --> Chosen spacing. Keep in mind that the distance between tile
        centers in different rows might deviate slightly. 
    `hexagon_shape` --> matplotlib polygon. The first array contains the corner 
        coordinates relative to the centroid. Centroids for each hexagon can be
        found under "coordinates" or "coordinates_filt".
