        Chains all functions to go from raw point data to regions. Use the
        individual functions for more control.

        Args:
            spacing (float): distance between tile centers, in same units as 
                the data. The actual spacing will have a verry small deviation 
                (tipically lower than 2e-9%) in the y axis, due to the 
                matplotlib hexbin function. The function makes hexagons with 
                the point up: â¬¡
            min_count (int):  Minimal number of molecules in a tile to keep the 
                tile in the dataset. The algorithm will generate a lot of empty 
                tiles, which are later discarded using the min_count threshold.
                Suggested to be at least 1.
            normalization_mode (str, optional): normalization method for 
                clustering. Choose from: "log", "sqrt" or "z" for log +1 
                transform, square root transform, or z scores respectively. 
                Defaults to 'log'.
            n_components (int, optional): Number of PCA components to use for
                clustering. Defaults to 100.
            clust_dist_threshold (float, optional): Distance threshold for 
                Scipy Agglomerative clustering. Defaults to 70.
            clust_neighbor_rings (int, optional): Number of rings around a 
                central tile to make connections between tiles for 
                Agglomerative Clustering with connectivity. 1 means connections
                with the 6 imediate neighbors. 2 means the first and second 
                ring, making 18 neigbors, etc. Defaults to 1.
            smooth_neighbor_rings (int, optional):  Number of rings around a 
                central tile to smooth over. 1 means connections with the 6 
                imediate neighbors. 2 means the first and second ring, making 
                18 neigbors, etc. Defaults to 1.
            smooth_cycles (int, optional): Number of smoothing cycles.
                Defaults to 1.
            boundary_decimals (int, optional): Due to inaccuracies in the 
                original hexagon tile  generation and rounding errors, the 
                points need to be rounded to return all unique points. If you 
                experience errors with the  generation of polygons downstream, 
                lower the number of decimals. Defaults to 7.
            smooth_polygon (bool, optional): Whether or not smooting of the 
                polygons is performed. Advised not to smooth, because smoothing
                has little effect and can cause holes inbetween polygons where
                3 polygons meet. Defaults to False.
            smooth_polygon_degree (int, optional): Degreen by which to smooth.
                Range between 1 and 7, wehere 7 causes the most smothing. 
                Defaults to 7.
            recount (bool, optional): Recount which points fall in which
                polygon. Uses paralellization to speed up, so not thread safe!
                Defaults to False.
            area_normalize (bool, optional): If True normalizes the counts by 
                area. Defaults to True.
            area_normalize_unit (str, optional): Unit to use for normalization.
                Use the 1D unit: "micrometer" will mean sqare micrometer.
                Defaults to 'micrometer'.
