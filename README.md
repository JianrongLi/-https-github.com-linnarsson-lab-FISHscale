pip install -e.
```
Clone or download the repository.  
Use the [single-dataset](https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/FISHscale/blob/master/example_notebooks/FISHscale_tutorial_single_dataset.ipynb) notebook to get started with single datasets.
  
If you want to use multiple datasets, download the data from [our website](http://mousebrain.org/)  
Then use the [multi-dataset](https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/FISHscale/blob/master/example_notebooks/FISHscale_tutorial_multi_dataset.ipynb) notebook to get started with multi-dataset objects.
